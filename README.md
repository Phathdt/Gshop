## Technology Stack

- **Go 1.17**: *Leverage the standard libraries as much as possible*
- **PostgreSQL**: *RDBMS of choice because of faster read due to its indexing model and safer transaction with better isolation levels handling*
- **Fiber**: *Fast and have respect for native net/http API*
- **Gorm**: *The fantastic ORM library for Golang*
- **JWT Token**: *Also implemented to demonstrate the decoupility*
- **Goose**: *Efficient schema generating, up/down migrating*
- **Docker** + **Docker-Compose**: *Containerization, what else to say ...*
- **Viper**: *Add robustness to configurations*
- **Github Actions CI**: *Make sure we don't push trash code into the codebase*

## Booting Up

**Docker**
```bash
docker-compose build

docker-compose up

# docker-compose down
```

**Local**
```bash
cp .env.sample .env

# insert some data in env like database url, debug level

source .env

# install migrate
brew install golang-migrate

# migrate
make migrate-up

# run app
make run

# enjoy

```

## Migration

**Generate migration**
```bash
make run args="migrate create xxx sql"
```

## Todos
- add manifest K8s
- deploy with Github Action and ArgoCD
- add replica postgres
- add more testable for repository, usecase, ...
